# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
I was motivated to learn the basics before the actual course starts.
I learned some basics in relation to HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git & GitHub, VS Code.
